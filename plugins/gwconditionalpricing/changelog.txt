## 1.2.8.1

    - Experimental improvements for speed, especially combined with calculations.

## 1.2.8

    - Fixed issue where comma-based currencies were treated as decimals when included in calculations; price was set on input-based Product fields as a number rather than a currency like GF does by default so 0.50 was converted to 50.00)

## 1.2.7

    - Updating pricing script to call updatePricing more efficiently; now only triggered when either the product field itself changes or a field on which the product is dependent changes

## 1.2.6

    - Fixed issue where infinite conditional logic loop was triggered when setting conditional price (caused by differences in previous value vs new value due to price formatting)
    - Updated pricing rule editor to display price in a currency-specific number format instead of always as a decimal (i.e. euro => '1.250,50' vs '1250.50')

## 1.2.5

    - Fixed a bug where file uploads were not saved due to field values being cached when temp entry object was created

    - Fixed issue where the price of product fields modified via conditional pricing was not correctly reflected when included in GF calculation fields
